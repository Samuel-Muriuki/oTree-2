In today's experiment, two randomly chosen participants will form a 2-person group to work on a joint project. In each group, there will be two roles A and B. A and B will make their decisions independently. However, their decisions will determine not only their own but also each other's payoff from the joint project. Pairs are independent, so whatever happens in one pair will not affect any other pair in any way.
There will be multiple rounds in the experiment, and each round will proceed in the same way. For two participants, they will NOT be in the same group for more than one round. In each round, both A and B will receive XX tokens (10 tokens = S$1). They will both decide 1) whether to carry out the joint project; and 2) how much to invest in the joint project. All the decisions and answers are recorded on the decision sheet.
